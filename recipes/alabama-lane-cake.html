    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Lane cake, also known as prize cake or Alabama Lane cake, is a four-layer white cake with a bourbon-spiked
        raisin
        filling that originated in the American South. It's the official state cake of Alabama.
    </p>
    <p>
        The base for Lane cake is a variation of the old-fashioned 1-2-3-4 cake (a classic cake recipe with one cup of
        butter, two cups of sugar, three cups of flour, and four eggs) that calls exclusively for eight egg whites
        instead of four whole eggs. This results in a spongier texture.
    </p>
    <p>
        The boozy filling traditionally contains egg yolks, sugar, butter, raisins, bourbon, and vanilla. Modern
        versions frequently feature pecans and coconut flakes.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li> 2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li> 1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li> 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li> ¾ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour four 8 inch
            round cake pans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cream 1 cup of the butter or margarine, 2 cups of the white sugar, and vanilla together until light and
            fluffy.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine flour, baking powder and salt. Add flour mixture to the butter mixture in three parts alternately
            with the milk in two parts, beginning and ending with flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat the egg whites until stiff. Gently fold the egg whites into the batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the batter evenly into the four prepared pans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
            clean. Allow cakes to cool. Once cool spread Lane Cake Filling between layers and frost with Seven Minute or
            Butter Frosting.
        </li>
        <li>
            To Make Lane Cake Filling: Put 1/2 cup of the butter or margarine and 1-1/4 cups of the white sugar into the
            top of a double boiler away from the heat. Beat together. Add egg yolks and beat well. Stir in water and
            brandy flavoring.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place over boiling water. Cook and stir until thickened. Add pecans, raisins, cherries and coconut. Stir
            filling until all ingredients are well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat. Allow filling to cool before spreading between cooled cake layers.
        </li>
